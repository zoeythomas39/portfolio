                <p>
                    I'm a University of Florida junior with a <strong>passion for writing</strong> in all its forms. Raised by an English teacher mother and journalist father, I grew up with a love for the written word. I've carried
                    that love to newsrooms and agencies where I've held positions both as a reporter and copywriter over the last three years.
                <br><br>
                    After arriving to UF, I also found an interest in <strong>data and web development</strong>. I'm completing a minor in statistics and hope to bring my coding and analysis skills into my future career.
